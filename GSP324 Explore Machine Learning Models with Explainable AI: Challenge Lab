1st task and 2nd task as given in the lab as it is

3rd task:-

Build and train your models
In the second cell of the Train your first model on the complete dataset section, add the following lines to create the model.

model = Sequential()
model.add(layers.Dense(8, input_dim=input_size))
model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, batch_size=32, epochs=10)

Copy the code for training the second model. Modify model to limited_model as well as train_data, train_labels to limited_train_data, limited_train_labels. The code for the second model should look like the following.

limited_model = Sequential()
limited_model.add(layers.Dense(8, input_dim=input_size))
limited_model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
limited_model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')
limited_model.fit(limited_train_data, limited_train_labels, batch_size=32, epochs=10)

Run the cells in this section and wait for the finish of model training.

4th task:-

Deploy the models to AI Platform
Moving on to the Deploy your models to the AI Platform section in the notebook.

Replace the values of GCP_PROJECT and MODEL_BUCKET with your project ID and a unique bucket name.
Change the REGION to us-central1 (Use the same region of the Notebook instance).
Run those three cells and then confirm the created bucket and the uploaded model files in Cloud Storage.

Create your first AI Platform model: complete_model


afterwards go to ai platformm in navigation menu and then select models in it

create models
then 
its version as per given informtion
